This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Perl related to comparing undefined values with strings using the 'eq' operator. The 'bug.pl' file contains the erroneous code, while 'bugSolution.pl' provides a corrected version.  The issue stems from Perl's flexible type handling, where 'undef' can sometimes implicitly convert to an empty string, causing unexpected results in comparisons. The solution employs more robust checking for defined values before comparison to improve the code's reliability.
